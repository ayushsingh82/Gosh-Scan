# GOSH-Scan

## Introduction

GOSH-Scan is a tool designed to simplify the tracking of transactions and balances within the gosh domain. Tracking transactions and balances through the gosh domain can be challenging, so GoshScan aims to provide a one-stop solution for tracking addresses, balances, internal transactions, and external transactions. We have connected .eth to .gosh through ICNS (Interchain naming system) https://app.icns.xyz/


## Features





- **Address Tracking**: Easily track addresses within the gosh domain.
- **Balance Monitoring**: Keep an eye on the balance of addresses.
- **Internal Transaction Tracking**: Monitor internal transactions within the gosh domain.
- **External Transaction Tracking**: Track external transactions involving gosh domain addresses.
- **Comprehensive Portfolio Overview**: Gosh-Scan provides a comprehensive overview of your GOSH domain portfolio, including detailed information such as time, hash, and more.
- **Future Development**: The future goal of GOSH-Scan is to evolve into a complete portfolio tracker for GOSH. This will include additional features such as portfolio performance analysis, asset allocation insights, and customizable reporting.

## How It Works

Gosh-Scan utilizes the .gosh domain to access and track transactions and balances within the GOSH ecosystem. By leveraging this domain, GOSH-Scan can provide users with real-time insights into their gosh domain activities.
